Hello, world!

This is a selection of the programming work I’ve done in school.
Some of it’s great, some of it isn’t. For examples of my documentation
skills, check out CS4233 and RBE3002-lab2. Lab3 wasn’t quite finished
because I broke my hip halfway through the class and barely finished
the semester. But lab3 shows some algorithmic work (A*).

I've included a couple of project reports, as well. I wrote the RBE3002
report by myself and the robotics senior project report was 95% me (team 
members offered bullet points describing what they did, I translated
them into prose :) ). The senior project report's more interesting,
but the 3002 report is a bit more digestable.
