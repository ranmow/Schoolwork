Hello, world!

This is a selection of the programming work I’ve done in school.
Some of it’s great, some of it isn’t. For examples of my documentation
skills, check out CS4233 and RBE3002-lab2. Lab3 wasn’t quite finished
because I broke my hip halfway through the class and barely finished
the semester.
